GeneralAudience: Here, I explain each project in a detailed, step-by-step manner,
including reports, presentations, and videos. No technical knowledge is required.

TechnicalKnowledge: In this folder, I provide a brief and technical explanation of my projects,
using mathematical and professional language, and sharing only files such as notebooks,
Python scripts, SQL scripts, and others.
